IAM = Identity Access Management, is a global service.

`Root` account is created by default however it shouldn't be used or shared

`Users` are individuals within your organization and can be grouped. They don't have to belong to a group or can belong to many groups if applicable

`Groups` can only contain users, not other groups

`Policies` are JSON documents that define the permissions for a user or group.

In `AWS` we will use the ***Least privilege principle*** meaning we will not give more permissions than a user needs.
